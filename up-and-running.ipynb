    "If you look at the last line of the message, you'll see that this is a **Syntax Error**, with the additional message that it found an unexpected EOF (end-of-file) while parsing.  Maybe that's a bit strange of an error, but also look at the preceding line which shows a small caret ('^') symbol pointing at one character past the last quotation mark.  This gives an indication that the error is happening here.  You were probably able to figure out that we are missing our ending parenthesis.\n",

In this case, the error message is probably more clear - we cannot add (or concatentate) a 'str' (string) and 'int' (integer) together (don't worry if the reason *why* this doesn't work isn't yet clear).\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors can be intimidating in Python because they include the entire \"call stack\" of a program when the interpreter encountered the error.  This just means that the error may be deeply nested within a number of functions and, at each level, the program reports the line number which called the inner function.  In my experience, it's almost always useful to scroll to the bottom of the error to find the root cause of what went wrong. \n"
