### Up and running with Python - CoF workshop
This is a set of modules for OSU's College of Forestry Python workshop first given in Spring 2018.  Each module addresses a different topic area and the last six will be presented in the workshop.  The first module (0-up-and-running) is an introduction to Python for the first time user to both Python and Jupyter notebooks.  

The first link below points to a binder version of the '0-up-and-running' module.  Just click on the "launch binder" link to be taken to that module's Jupyter notebook.  All other modules should be run in a localhost Jupyter session:
